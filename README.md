# Tracking Backend Demo

A demonstration AppEngine/Flask app that manages a user event data stream to 
BigQuery.

A bare-bones OAuth2 authentication flow has been implemented. See ```main.py``` 
and ```auth.py``` for details and instructions.

## Set up the environment
```bash
virtualenv -p python3.6 venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
``` 

## Start a local server
```bash
export GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT="your-project"

source venv/bin/activate
python main.py
```

## Initialise Dataset
Any request to the /init endpoint will generate the following items:
* a dataset 'bobs_knob_shops', with
* two tables: 'events_0' and 'events_1'
```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/init
```

## Inserting events
Events are inserted using the ```/events``` endpoint. The endpoint accepts a 
POST call with a json body describing one or more events.

The following will insert the call described in the example json file. 
```bash
curl -X POST -i http://localhost:8080/events \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    --data "$(cat example.json)"
```

## Triggering the daily aggregation job
The following will trigger the daily aggregation job. It is designed to run 
every day; a few hours after midnight (UTC).
```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/events/aggregation
```  

## Spawn a demo dataset
You can spawn a demo dataset with the ```/demo_init``` endpoint. This endpoint 
will initialise the dataset and fill it with some data.

The data is selected so you can observe the logic of the aggregation job. 
Initially there will be:
* events from yesterday's sessions in one table
* events from a session starting yesterday, continuing past midnight and thus 
split over two tables
* events for a few sessions in the current day table
* no sessions in the sessions table

After running the job there will be:
* all sessions closed before midnight in the sessions table
* all events from the session spanning midnight in the current day table
* today's events (untouched) in the current day table
* an empty table for yesterday / tomorrow
